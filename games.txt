#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

In this game unit I finaly learn how to make an Ia impacted by the environement which leads me a bit closer to how an IA works in a video game
As a chess player understanding how IA works for chess and How they calculate how good of a position it is 
using utility and everything describe by this assignement is really interesting . 
I am curious how to use this with an IA that learns through deep learning to see how to do both.
Countering the exponential part of the algorithms through recurciveness and smart heuristic isreally cool.
